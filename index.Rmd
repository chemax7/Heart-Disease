## Introduction

Today, heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States. My project investigates the risk factors of heart disease, including smoking, diabetes, and obesity. I also investigated whether or not heart disease was more prevalent in a particular race or gender.

As shown below, I found that the majority of individuals with heart disease in the data were of American Indian/Alaskan Native descent. Furthermore, I discovered that the heart disease was least prevalent in the Asian population. In addition, the percentage gap of heart disease between each group seems to get larger with age.
